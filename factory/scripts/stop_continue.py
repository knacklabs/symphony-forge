"""The Stop hook: from plan approval to PR, the run does not stop for us.

This hook used to be advisory by design — it printed a reminder and always
returned continue. That left the real exit open: a pre-tool gate can refuse the
question TOOL, but nothing stops an agent ending its turn and asking in prose.
One story took 26 interruptions that way, 19 of them for a review-budget
ceiling, a write scope short by a file the work implied, or a sandbox block
with a documented path — every one answerable without a human.

So while a stage is open and the task is unfinished, ending the turn is
refused, and the refusal says what to do instead. The escape is one command:
name the decision that does not exist. That is cheap when the question is real
and impossible to write honestly when it is not.

Fails OPEN on anything unexpected: a missed interruption costs one question, a
hook that traps the session costs everything.
