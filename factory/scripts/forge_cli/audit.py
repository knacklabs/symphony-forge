"""forge audit — loop-health: the improvement loops are themselves watched.

The harness is a graph of improvement loops (findings escalation, lessons,
deferrals, structured reviews). Each emits advisories — and an advisory
nobody acts on decays into theater: the warning fires forever, the trigger
never re-checks, the lesson's globs rot after a rename. This audit is the
loop that watches the watchers (decision record: loop-health-audit). It is
ADVISORY, never a ship gate — audit output routes work to the roadmap; it
does not hold an unrelated task hostage.

Checks:
- ignored escalations: a RECURRING finding class with ships since it was
  flagged and no consolidating decision or refactor story
- stale deferrals: open rows past the age threshold — re-check the trigger
- decayed lessons: applies_to globs matching zero tracked files
- review drift: the latest shipped task's findings carry no structure, so
  they can never cluster

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- state audit
#
# The harness validates TRANSITIONS -- "may I move from A to B?" -- and never
# re-validates STATE. Every gate checks its own precondition at the moment of
# the move and then trusts the record forever after. So an artifact that was
# hand-written, or a claim that was true once and is not any more, is
# undetectable: nothing ever asks whether what is recorded still agrees with
# the repository.
#
# These checks re-derive each recorded claim from the repo and report where the
# two disagree. Read-only, and deliberately so: it reports, it never repairs.
# A repair would be the same act of asserting-without-checking that makes the
# records untrustworthy in the first place.
