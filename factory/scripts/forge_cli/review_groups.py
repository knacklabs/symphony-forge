"""A big diff is reviewed in parallel groups, each retried on its own (0078).

The reviewer tool splits any prompt over 512 KB into chunks and runs them one
after another inside one call. WF-1A T1 (2026-09-14): a 900 KB diff, four
chunks of 20-40 minutes each, over an hour per review round, and one chunk
that came back truncated cost the whole hour. Nothing in that call could be
retried alone, and the lockfile alone was a chunk's worth of noise.

Forge now does the splitting itself, before the call, and only when the tool
would split anyway: the diff's product files are dealt into the fewest groups
whose prompt fits, each group gets its own review worktree and its own
three-lens Codex run, all released together and joined. A group whose result
is refused is re-run alone, up to twice, with the refusal's cause written into
its brief. The group results are merged into the exact shape the tool uses
for its own chunks, so the recorder, the projection and every reader stay
unchanged.

What a group sees. Its bundle is only its files' diff, but its tree is the
whole task tip: the group's base is a synthetic commit with the group's files
put back to the task base and everything else at the tip, so `base...HEAD`
is the group's diff and HEAD is the tree that ships. A verdict on a contract
whose change sits in another group is read from the tree, never guessed
(0076); the worst verdict per contract still wins across groups.

A diff that fits in one prompt is one group: the same single call as before.
`FORGE_REVIEW_SPLIT_BYTES` lowers the split point for probes and tests.
