"""The review lenses read the tree they judge (decision 0070).

The autoreview skill starts its engine in an empty temporary folder, and the
engine's read-only sandbox refuses every path outside that folder. A reviewer
told to open the callee of a changed line answered "CreateProcess rejected
access ... blocked by policy" and then wrote `missing` for a contract the
callee satisfied (probe, 2026-09-13) -- the same shape as eleven of WF-1 T5's
first twenty-five blockers, and the reason a contract about unchanged code
came back `partial` round after round: the reviewer could only guess.

The skill accepts an external Codex binary. This module writes a launcher that
swaps the empty folder for the review worktree and starts the real Codex
otherwise unchanged. The sandbox stays read-only (the skill passes no sandbox
flag, so `codex exec` keeps its read-only default); only where it points
changes, and the worktree is a fresh detached checkout with no ignored files.

On Windows one more thing is needed. The skill passes `--ignore-user-config`,
which also drops `[windows] sandbox = "elevated"` from the user's Codex
config; without that sandbox Codex refuses EVERY command in read-only mode
("CreateProcess rejected the command: blocked by policy" for `Get-Location`
itself, probe 2026-09-13). The launcher carries that one key through as a
`-c` override, and points CODEX_HOME back at the home that holds the sandbox's
set-up state (the skill's runtime home has none, so Codex re-ran set-up and
its UAC prompt was cancelled: error 1223). Then the reviewer's read-only shell
works at all.
