"""forge codex status — is the delegated run still moving?

A stalled Codex job used to be invisible until somebody thought to ask. The
companion already records everything needed to see it — status, phase, the
write flag, timestamps, the log path — in its own job registry; nothing read
it.

DELIBERATELY ADVISORY. This reads a third-party path this repo does not own,
so it always exits 0 and never blocks a ship: a diagnostic over data outside
the contract must not be able to fail a gate (decision 0018).
