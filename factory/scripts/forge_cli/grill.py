"""forge grill run — release the read-only cold reader through the ledger.

Grills were the one Codex release the harness could not see. A delegation
records a pid and a review now does too, so a launcher killed uncatchably is
still detectable afterwards; a grill went out through the plugin directly, so
nothing on the forge side knew it had ever started. That is backwards: the
grill is the release the coordinator is told to WATCH every single round.

Releasing it through `launch_companion` — the same launcher a delegation uses —
gives it the same treatment for free: the pid and process create-time are
ledgered before the wait, the process tree is reaped on exit, the argv is
pinned, and `forge codex status` reports it dead if its launcher was killed.

It stays READ-ONLY. `write=False` means no delegation lock is taken and the
row can never satisfy `stage done`, which matches on a write launch bound to a
task contract. The cold read returns findings; recording the gate remains the
coordinator's job through the ledger-matched recorder, exactly as before.

    the Skill tool with 'grilling'" — and `grilling`, the 2KB skill that holds
    the actual technique, is installed only on the Claude side. So a Codex
    reader told to load grill-me finds a pointer to a Skill tool its runtime
    does not have, and falls back to the harness contract alone.

    `_skill_text` already looks in BOTH runtimes' skill directories, which is
    what lets the Claude-side text travel to Codex inside the brief. Prefer the
    real skill, accept grill-me only when it is not merely the stub, and carry
    a written floor when neither is installed — the same reason delegate
