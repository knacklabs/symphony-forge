"""forge grill run — release the read-only cold reader through the ledger.

Grills were the one Codex release the harness could not see. A delegation
records a pid and a review now does too, so a launcher killed uncatchably is
still detectable afterwards; a grill went out through the plugin directly, so
nothing on the forge side knew it had ever started. That is backwards: the
grill is the release the coordinator is told to WATCH every single round.

Releasing it through `launch_companion` — the same launcher a delegation uses —
gives it the same treatment for free: the pid and process create-time are
ledgered before the wait, the process tree is reaped on exit, the argv is
pinned, and `forge codex status` reports it dead if its launcher was killed.

It stays READ-ONLY. `write=False` means no delegation lock is taken and the
row can never satisfy `stage done`, which matches on a write launch bound to a
task contract. The cold read returns findings; recording the gate remains the
coordinator's job through the ledger-matched recorder, exactly as before.
