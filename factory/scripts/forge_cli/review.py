"""forge review <task-id> — release Codex for a task's three-lens review and
record the three artifacts as that task's proof (decisions 0011, 0049).

One command replaces the hand-assembled skill invocation the coordinator used
to get wrong: it pins the task tip in a clean detached worktree (so harness
writes in the main tree cannot abort the run), reviews the WHOLE task diff from
the task's recorded base (branch mode; `--mode commit` would see only the last
commit), runs the autoreview skill once per lens with Codex as the engine,
drops findings on harness bookkeeping paths, derives each lens artifact, parses
the quality verdicts from the reviewer's prose, and records all three through
the existing schema-validated recorder. It always ends by printing the exact
next command.

change would do) — but a diff that drops validation, error handling, security, or
accessibility to look smaller is the OPPOSITE finding. The constitution's coding
