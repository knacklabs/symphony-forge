"""Asking the human is gated once the plan is approved and a stage is open.

Its own module — test_gates.py is one 690-test file where every added branch
collides with every other.

Every other fix removes REASONS to stop. This is the only one that gates the
act of stopping, which is why it exists: the rule about which interruptions the
orchestrator settles itself was written down in WORKFLOW.md and ignored, and 19
of one story's 26 interruptions were mechanical anyway. Prose does not bind.

Deliberately an allow-list of DENIALS. A reason the harness cannot self-answer
passes — after the challenge — because a novel situation probably does need the
human. It is recorded, so a repeated one becomes a number rather than an
impression formed over eighteen rounds.
