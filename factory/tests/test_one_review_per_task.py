"""One review per task: `forge review` stamps the stage when no lens blocks.

Before: a stage-local autoreview loop had to produce a clean stamp (recorded by
hand through `record_review_from_json.py --aspect stage-local`) before
`stage done`, and the three-lens `forge review` then reviewed the same diff
again with a narrower brief. On ASKFLOOR-1-T5a that was nine stage rounds plus
three lens rounds by the same engine, and the second review contradicted an
approved contract. Now the lens review IS the stamp: a run with no blocking
finding binds itself to the tree, `stage done` and `task pr-ready` seal on it,
and P2 findings are follow-ups that never sink the score below the seal floor.
