"""A grill round is told what was already answered — and nothing more.

Its own module — test_gates.py is one 690-test file where every added branch
collides with every other.

The brief carried only the artifact, so round 11 knew nothing of rounds 1-10. A
cold reader with no memory does not re-find the same gaps; it finds DIFFERENT
ones, so the rounds never shrink. One story reached eleven with the coordinator
asking the human how to escape; another ran forty-four across its gates.

The answers were on disk the whole time — `grill-rounds/*.json` is what the
recorder validates rounds against. Measured on that story: 64 questions, 14.5 KB,
2.8% of the launcher's prompt budget.
