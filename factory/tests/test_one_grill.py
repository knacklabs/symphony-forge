"""One cold read per gate, with the human's questions asked inside it.

The loop was never a habit — it was forced. Fixing a finding means EDITING the
artifact, and the gates bind a recorded grill to the artifact's digest, so the
edit invalidated the grill that authorised it and a re-read became mandatory.
Re-reading is also what diverges: a fresh unconstrained reader has no memory of
the last one's findings, so it returns a DIFFERENT frontier. Each round
manufactured the next round's work; stories reached eleven, twenty-six and
forty rounds, the last costing six hours.

The shape under test: one unconstrained cold read → every finding put to the
human in that same grill → one amendment → a BOUNDED confirm read that is
handed the findings and the answers and may return nothing else. A confirm
cannot open a frontier, so it terminates.

Its own module for the same reason test_grill_round_cap.py is: test_gates.py is
one very large file where every added branch collides with every other.
