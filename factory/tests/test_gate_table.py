"""The gate table, and roadmap heal's refusal to lose a status.

Its own module: test_gates.py is one 680-test file, so every branch adding a
test there collides with every other.

The tree here follows the blast radius, not the diff — a gate table is only
worth having if the things DOWNSTREAM of it (the recorder, the ledgered
launcher, the handover gates that read a recorded grill months later) still
behave. Each level below is a level further from the change.
