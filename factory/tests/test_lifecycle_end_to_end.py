"""The whole lifecycle, replayed from the story that motivated all of it.

Its own module — test_gates.py is one 690-test file where every added branch
collides with every other.

WF-1 T1's handover recorded what it cost: ~20 task-grill rounds, 50 Codex jobs,
26 interruptions of the human. Its own diagnosis named three causes — the
freshness chain, batching findings badly, and a large task. The first is the
harness's, and this replays it end to end with the real commands: approve,
open the stage, deliver, come back for the fix round, and reach the PR without
the human being asked anything they had already decided.

The unit tests prove each gate. This proves they compose — that fixing the
grill did not open the approval, and gating interruptions did not block the
work.
