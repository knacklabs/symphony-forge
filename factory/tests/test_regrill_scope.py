"""What actually forces a re-grill, and what must never.

Its own module — test_gates.py is one 690-test file where every added branch
collides with every other.

Measured cost of the old rule on one story: eighteen grill rounds. The grill
bound the WHOLE task contract plus the whole product tree, so resolving a grill
finding — which is done by editing the contract — invalidated the grill that
found it, and committing the implementation invalidated it again. Neither loop
can converge. Raising a review-budget ceiling from 38 files to 58, pure
bookkeeping, cost a full adversarial round.
