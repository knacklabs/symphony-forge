"""Per-task proof is visible to the readers, not only to the writers.

`forge task start` stamps `task_id` into the worktree's run pointer, and the
recorders resolve through `proof_path`, so a per-task run records verify.json
and tests.json under `.factory/stories/<story>/tasks/<task>/`. The ship gate
and `check_task_proof` already read task-first with a story fallback. Five
other readers did not: `forge review`, the board, the phase summary, the stage
rows and the review brief resolved story-only, so each of them looked where a
per-task run never writes. `forge review <task>` failed with "verify.json is
not recorded" while both files sat on disk, recorded minutes earlier.

`proof_read_path` is the reader-side counterpart: the task's copy when a task
owns the run and has recorded one, the story's otherwise. The fallback is what
keeps story-level runs and older stories working unchanged.
