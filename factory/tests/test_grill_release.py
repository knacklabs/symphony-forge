"""The grill release goes through the ledgered launcher.

In its own module on purpose. test_gates.py is one 680-test file, so every
branch that adds a test lands in the same region and re-conflicts whenever
another merges first — three times over for this change alone. Separate files
do not collide, and the resolution stops being a keep-both merge that can
silently duplicate a definition (Python shadows a repeated `def` without
complaint).
