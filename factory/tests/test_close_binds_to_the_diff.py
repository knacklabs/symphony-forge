"""Closeout binds to the product diff, and closes with one command.

Marking a task done took longer than building it. The review stamp hashed
the contract text, the brief text and every tracked file; the launch hashed
the contract and the brief; the grill hashed the measurement fields. None of
those is the code a reviewer read, so a scope widening, a decision record or
a contract re-record staled a review of unchanged code -- and one contract
edit orphaned the launch, staled the stamp and staled the grill at once. On
WF-1 T2 that was 4.5 hours, six reviews, one grill, a plan rewrite, a human
re-approval and a no-op Codex launch after a clean build.

Its own module: test_gates.py is one very large file where every added
branch collides with every other.
