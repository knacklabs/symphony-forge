# Grilling: the coordinator's contract

What the coordinating session does around a cold read: who may record which gate, why one cold read is the whole grill, what the reader is and is not told, and how the outcome is recorded. The cold reader's own contract (what to hunt at each gate) is `factory/prompts/griller.md`; the technique is Matt Pocock's `grilling` skill, installed by `./forge doctor --fix`.

**Independence is the whole point.** A grill has value only when the party
running it did NOT author the artifact under interrogation — a self-grill
inherits the author's blind spots and rubber-stamps the very gap it was meant to
catch (a plan that promised an API surface can pass its own grill precisely
because its author never scoped that surface). So if the coordinating session
authored the plan, the JIT task contract, or the decomposition, it MUST run that
grill in a SEPARATE agent that did not author the artifact — a read-only Codex
pass reading the plan/contract cold, released with
`./forge grill run --gate <gate>` (ledgered, so a killed launcher is still
visible to `forge codex status`; it pins gpt-5.6-sol @ high from
harness.yaml) — rather than certify its own work inline. Codex on `gpt-5.6-sol` @ high
is the required cold reader for planning grills: a fresh model context fully
independent of the authoring session, and because it is read-only it never
writes, so the write-lock that gates the write companion does not apply. Do NOT
use a Claude sub-agent for the grill, and never grill your own work inline.
Interrogate as an adversary trying to break the handover, never as its author
defending it.

RELEASE IT THROUGH THE HARNESS. `./forge grill run --gate <gate>` composes the cold-read brief (this contract plus the artifact) and releases Codex through the SAME ledgered launcher a delegation uses: the pid is recorded before the wait, so a grill whose launcher is killed still shows up in `forge codex status` instead of vanishing. It is read-only, so it takes no delegation lock and can never satisfy `stage done`. Recording the gate stays yours — the cold read only returns findings.

WHICH RUNTIME CAN RECORD WHICH GATE — get this wrong and you will chase a
refusal you cannot satisfy. ALL SIX gates match the AskUserQuestion ledger and
are therefore CLAUDE-ONLY, each with a floor of ONE logged round: `--gate spec`,
`--gate signoff`, `--gate epics`, `--gate requirements`, `--gate plan` and
`--gate task` — the floors live in `grill_gates.GATES`, one row per gate.
`signoff` and `epics` used to sit outside that check and so recorded with ZERO
rounds behind them; they now answer to it like every other gate.

ONE round is a FLOOR, never a target. Keep going until a round comes back clean
AND the next one stays clean — a single quiet round after a noisy one is a
coincidence, not convergence. The ledger files are written ONLY by `post_tool_use.py` on a
Claude Code AskUserQuestion event; `.codex/hooks.json` registers no PostToolUse
hook, so Codex cannot produce them and neither can a subagent. Delegating a
ledger-matched grill to Codex returns a well-formed payload that the recorder
then refuses, with nothing you can do to satisfy it — the payload was never the
problem, the runtime was.

For those four ledger-matched gates, independence is a COLD READ,
not necessarily a separate process. The recorder accepts ONLY rounds that match a
logged AskUserQuestion record (`record_grill_from_json.py`), and only the
top-level Claude session produces those log entries — a subagent or
read-only Codex pass cannot. So for those grills the top-level session drives
the rounds through AskUserQuestion itself — but because the coordinating session
authored the plan, the independent cold-read pass is MANDATORY, not optional: on
EVERY round release a fresh READ-ONLY Codex pass with
`./forge grill run --gate <gate> [--task <id>]` that reads the plan/contract
cold and returns findings — never a
Claude sub-agent, never grill your own work inline — then carry ALL of those
findings into your own AskUserQuestion rounds (the recorder rejects rounds not in
the ledger, so the top-level session must still ask). Read cold, as an adversary
who did not write it.

ONE COLD READ PER GATE — put every question to the human INSIDE it. The old
shape was Codex grill → your rounds → amend → Codex grill AGAIN, looping until
clean. That loop cannot converge: a fresh reader has no memory of what the last
one found, so it returns a DIFFERENT frontier rather than a shorter one, and the
artifact you amended to close round one becomes round two's input. Stories
reached eleven, twenty-six and forty rounds that way; the last cost six hours.
`forge grill run` now REFUSES a second unconstrained read on a gate that has
already been read since its last recorded pass.

So the WHOLE grill is:

1. `./forge grill run --gate <gate>` — one cold read. WATCH it.
2. Clean? Record the pass and approve. Nothing else happens.
3. Otherwise resolve every finding the REPOSITORY answers yourself — open the
   file and settle it. Take to the human only what the repository cannot
   answer: a decision nobody has made, a priority, a tradeoff between two
   workable shapes. Put those through AskUserQuestion with your recommended
   answer first, all of them, now. There is no later round to save the hard
   ones for, and a finding is not a menu.
4. Amend the artifact ONCE, to what they decided.
5. Record the pass against the AMENDED version, then approve exactly once.

The price is stated plainly, twice over: nothing independent re-reads the
amended version, and a gap this reader misses is not caught by a second reader
at this gate. Both surface at the next gate, or in review. That is the trade
for ending a loop that was costing whole days.

If the human's answers changed the artifact's SHAPE — a component dropped, a
different approach chosen — the amended artifact is not the one that was read
in any useful sense. Say so and read again: `./forge grill run --gate <gate>
--reread "<what changed shape>"`. It is a choice with a recorded reason, not a
way around the rule, and the five-read cap still backstops it. (EVERY gate is ledger-matched — signoff and epics no
longer excepted — so no gate can be recorded by a read-only Codex grill alone:
the top-level session asks the round and records it.)

FRESH CONTEXT, AND THE ANSWERS SO FAR. Every round is a NEW read-only Codex
session — that independence is the whole point. But a reader that knows nothing
of the earlier rounds does not re-find the same gaps, it finds DIFFERENT ones,
so the rounds never shrink and the grill has no natural end. `./forge grill run`
therefore carries every question already put to the human and the answer they
chose, read from the ledger the recorder validates against.

That gives the reader two obligations: do not re-raise settled questions, and
CHECK EACH ANSWER — that the artifact honours it, and that it contradicts no
other answer, accepted decision or constitution rule. An answer can be wrong, or
right and never applied; saying so is part of the read.

Do NOT tell the reader where to concentrate. A cold read is worth having because
it is unconstrained, and steering it toward the diff is how the thing nobody
looked at survives every round. More information, no direction.

## Recording the outcome

Method:

1. Read the artifacts in scope FIRST; derive your question list from actual
   text, citing it (`BRIEF.md says X; decision 0003 says Y — which wins?`).
2. Interrogate in ROUNDS until the frontier is empty — not one pass. Each
   round, put the questions whose prerequisites are already settled to the
   human (PM or EM) with your recommended answer; their answers reshape the
   tree and unblock the next round's questions. Stop a single question when it
   would only confirm what a document already states; stop the grill only when
   no gap or contradiction remains unasked. In Claude Code, deliver each
   round's frontier through the AskUserQuestion tool (recommended answer
   first), not prose. For every ledger-matched gate (`spec`, `requirements`,
   `plan`, `task`) the recorder requires
   the FINAL round in the payload to carry `"frontier_empty": true` — that flag
   is how it confirms you stopped because the frontier closed, not because you
   ran out of patience; it is set by hand on the last `rounds` entry, never by
   the ledger. A zero-gap contract still needs at least one such round (every
   gate's floor is 1, and a floor is not a target), so ask a genuine closing
   question
   (e.g. "any remaining gap before we hand off?") and mark it `frontier_empty`.
3. Every finding lands somewhere real before the verdict: a doc edit, a
   `./forge decision new <slug>` record, or an explicit non-blocking entry
   in `open_items`. An `open_items` entry that PARKS scope also gets a
   deferral row with a revisit trigger (`./forge defer add`) — parked scope
   without a trigger is scope silently dropped. Unresolved blocking
   findings ⇒ verdict `blocked`.
4. Record the outcome (schema: `factory/schemas/grill.json`,
   `"generated_by": "griller"`):

   A task-grill input uses this recorded shape (the recorder adds its own
   task id, digests, commit, and timestamps):

```json
{
  "generated_by": "griller",
  "verdict": "pass",
  "gaps": [],
  "contradictions": [],
  "resolutions": ["What was sanctioned"],
  "inspected_refs": ["path/or/path:symbol"],
  "current_flow": "What the repository does now",
  "criteria_map": {"criterion": "proof"},
  "decision": "keep",
  "new_abstractions": ["None"],
  "rounds": [{"question": "Finding or choice", "options": ["Recommended", "Alternative"], "chosen": "Recommended", "frontier_empty": true}],
  "citations": [{"finding": "Repo-answerable finding", "source": "path:symbol"}],
  "open_items": []
}
```

   Each `rounds` entry has a non-empty `question`, two to four non-empty
   string `options`, and a `chosen` value equal to one option. Each citation
   is `{finding, source}`. Every string in `gaps` must be covered by an equal
   `rounds[].question` or `citations[].finding`.

   For every gate — all six are ledger-matched — extra recorder rules bind
   (this is what makes an otherwise well-formed payload fail):
   - Rounds must match the AskUserQuestion ledger and meet the gate floor
     (1 for every gate, and a floor is not a target); the final round carries
     `"frontier_empty": true`. A
     zero-gap grill still records its floor of real rounds — never zero.
   - `--gate task` only: `criteria_map` is a THREE-WAY equality — its KEYS must
     equal the frontier task's `acceptance_criteria` set AND the set of its
     `plan_contracts[].statement` values, exactly (no extra key, none missing);
     each value is the non-empty proof for that criterion. Author the task's
     `acceptance_criteria` and its `plan_contracts` statements as the SAME
     strings so there is one coherent key set to satisfy.

```bash
python3 factory/scripts/record_grill_from_json.py --gate <spec|signoff|epics|requirements|plan|task> --input <json> [--input-digest <artifact>] [--task <id>]
```

5. For every gate except task, commit the resolution edits
   BEFORE recording the grill — those gates check freshness against BOTH
   committed history and the working tree: any guarded doc changing after the
   grill (even uncommitted) stales it. (The sign-off / epics-approved decision
   records themselves are expected afterwards and don't stale it.) The task
   gate instead binds directly to the re-recorded task contract digest; the JIT
   sequence does not require a commit between re-recording and grilling. But that
   digest still folds in the product tree, so record the task grill LAST — after
   any docs/ or factory/scripts commits: a tracked change outside .factory/ and
   plans/ that lands between grilling and `task approve`/`stage start` re-stales
   it and forces a re-grill.
6. `--input-digest` is REQUIRED for the spec, epics, and plan gates: pass the
   exact spec / roadmap input / plan draft you interrogated. The gate verifies the
   digest — grilling version A never approves an edited version B; if the
   artifact changes, re-grill it. For `--gate task`, pass `--task <id>` and NO
   `--task-digest` — that flag was removed and the recorder rejects it; the
   recorder derives the grounding digest itself from the protected contract,
   approved plan, and product tree, and stores the result at
   `.factory/grills/tasks/<id>.json`.
